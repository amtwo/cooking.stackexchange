### Q: What is the binding agent in eggs?
<h1>Background</h1>

<p>I am someone who has a family history of high LDL cholesterol and my LDL is within 4 points of 100 (the barrier between "ok" and "healthy").  Therefore when I cook eggs straight up, I always cook without the yolk, since the yolk has all the cholesterol of the egg.  However, I have never done this when cooking pancakes, cake, cookies, etc.  Therefore I wanted to know if I could use egg for it's intended function (i.e. binding mixed ingredients) without the yolk.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>What is the binding agent in eggs, is it the white, the yolk, or both?</p>

<br><br>
### Answer 
<p>Egg whites contain a significant amount of protein, which is an excellent binder when cooked. This protein is what makes a cooked egg white somewhat rubbery.</p>

<p>Egg yolks contain lecithin, which is an emulsifier. The lecithin in an egg yolk is what combines with oil to make the emulsion we know as mayonnaise.</p>

<p>The white (with its protein) and yolk (with its lecithin and fat) are both critical to the chemistry when baking. If you eliminate just the yolk, you may get a tough and flat result. Substitutes like silken tofu, yogurt, applesauce, or mashed banana can all be used to replace either the yolk or a whole egg.</p>

<p>The best substitute will depend on the exact recipe and desired result. Applesauce and banana tend to impart added flavor, which can be a consideration as well.</p>
