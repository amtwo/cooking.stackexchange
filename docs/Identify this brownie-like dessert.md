### Q: Identify this brownie-like dessert
<p>When I was a kid, there was a dessert that would frequently be at pot-lucks that was a brownie-like dessert. It's been a long time since I had it so don't remember the details exactly but it was like a brownie with a greenish mint cream/marshmallow layer on top and then a thin chocolate layer on top of that.  I'd love to make it again but have no idea where to find the recipe.  Does anyone know what this dessert would be called?</p>

### Answer 
<p>It sounds like you're describing a &quot;Grasshopper brownie&quot; which is a sort of &quot;grasshopper pie and brownie mashup&quot; dessert.</p>
<p>Grasshopper pie is a chocolate crust pie with mint cream filling. And for grasshopper brownies, it lends that minty cream filling to a layered brownie variation.</p>
