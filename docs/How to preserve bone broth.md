### Q: How to preserve bone broth?
<p>I will soon receive a few kg of fresh boar bones.  From these, I want to make bone broth and preserve them in Weck jars, as I don't have a freezer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I do not have a pressure cooker of any kind.  What's my best bet to minimise the risk of spoilage or botulism?  How long can I realistically keep the preserved bone broth?</p>
<p>I've read about some approaches boiling the jars twice with a two day wait at room temperature in-between, killing the C. botulinum bacteria as they leave their spore stage.  However, I'm not sure if that'll actually do the trick.</p>

### Answer 
<p>When canning to make shelf-stable finished product, you must follow tested recipes directly to ensure proper preservation -- following both the method and processing time carefully.</p>
<p>To preserve stock/broth safely you will need to use a pressure canner. This method of food preservation is used because the food item is meat-based and low in acidity.</p>
<p>I'm not aware of any other method to make stock/broth shelf stable &amp; meet food safety guidelines.</p>
<p>Your options are to either pressure can or to freeze. Any other method will not guarantee that stock/broth will be safe to leave at room temperature.</p>
