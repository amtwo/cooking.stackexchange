### Q: Is it safe to use lye-based oven cleaner on a stainless steel pan?
<p>I'm currently in the middle of seasoning some new pans that I received from made in. I accidently messed up one of my pans by not wiping off the excess seasoning wax and now the pan has dots all over it.</p>
<p>In the past I have used the 24 hour soak in oven cleaner method for my wok. I'm curious since I'm using stainless would the oven cleaner (Easy Off, a brand whose active ingredient is lye) be safe to use to help remove the messed up patina? My pan is stainless clad and manufactured by made in.</p>

### Answer 
<p>Firstly, there should be no need to season a stainless clad pan. Stainless pans are generally kept pristine, with any oil residue scrubbed off after use. Seasoning is done on cast iron and <em>carbon</em> steel (which is black and looks like thin cast iron). I'm not aware of any guidance that suggests seasoning stainless steel in the same way cast iron is.</p>
<p>Oven cleaner is essentially just lye, mixed into a form factor to make it a spray on foamy cleaner. Lye is a strong base (the opposite of a strong acid), and can be similarly caustic and harsh on surfaces. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/how-to-restore-a-stainless-steel-sink/2018/04/20/ff01fd88-3f31-11e8-a7d1-e4efec6389f0_story.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This article</a> outlines the damage that can be caused by it on certain stainless steel surfaces. It also contains guidance directly from the manufacturer of the Easy-Off brand that it's designed to be safe for stainless steel <em>inside the oven</em> (such as the oven racks), and not for other stainless steel surfaces.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/2018/05/how-to-clean-stainless-steel-pots-and-pans.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Serious Eats</a> has a recommendation to use oven cleaner as a <em>last resort</em> after using other cleaners and scrubbing for the <strong>bottom &amp; exterior</strong> of a stainless pan. I would <strong>not</strong> use oven cleaner on the interior cooking surface of a stainless steel pan.</p>
