### Q: White wine vinegar query
<p>How long does white wine vinegar last if kept in a sealed bottle? Does this apply to the age of all vinegars kept in a sealed bottle?</p>

<br><br>
### Answer 
<p>For white vinegar: basically forever. </p>

<p>Vinegar is acidic, so most bacteria won't grow in it. Plain white vinegar in a sealed container will keep longer than you'll be around to use it.</p>

<p>Some vinegars (balsamic, wine vinegar, etc) can experience flavor changes &amp; other undesirable effects when exposed to air, light, or extreme temperatures. Stored in a sealed container in a cool, dark place, they will keep for a very long time--but not always forever.</p>
