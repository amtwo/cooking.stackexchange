### Q: How can a flat rotating disk whip egg whites?
<p>The <a href="https://www.bamix.com/shop/eu_en/beater.html" rel="noreferrer">Bamix 'beater' attachment</a> is just a flat disk which rotates on an immersion blender. When it rotates the disk stays mostly in place, it doesn't displace the liquid in a way that moving a traditional whisk would.</p>
<p>How does that beater attachment work? For example, this <a href="https://youtu.be/ntaEWha1g_g?t=60" rel="noreferrer">promotional video using the attachment</a> shows egg whites from two eggs turn into foam in less than 30 seconds. I have the attachment and contrary to my expectations it's just a flat disk without any ridges to increase friction when spinning around in the liquid.</p>
<p>How does this form of whisking work?</p>

### Answer 
<h2>The flat beater blade isn't quite flat.</h2>
<p>At least, it's not flat with respect to the axis of rotation.</p>
<p>The beater blade is a smooth disk, but it's mounted at a slight angle so that when it spins, there's a &quot;wobble.&quot; It doesn't spin in a flat/smooth circle.</p>
<p>The mounting angle works kind of like a fan, with a single, solid blade. The angle and the rapid speed combine with the solid blade to create a lot of turbulence. Unlike a fan that creates a single direction of flow, the solid blade is pushing and pulling as the &quot;wobble&quot; moves up and down.</p>
<p>That &quot;wobble-induced turbulence&quot; creates something very much like what a whisk does, just at a higher speed and smaller area.</p>
