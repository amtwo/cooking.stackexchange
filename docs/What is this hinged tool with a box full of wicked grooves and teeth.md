### Q: What is this hinged tool with a box full of wicked grooves and teeth?
<p>Recently, while cleaning out my mother's kitchen, we came across this tool:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/oMmAU.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/oMmAU.jpg" alt="enter image description here" /></a></p>
<p>When closed, it is about 8 inches long (the box at the end is maybe 2 inches by 2 inches by an inch or so).  The two sides come apart very easily.  The tool is quite light-weight, and seems to be made of aluminum.  Other than that, I have idea what it could be, and there seemed to be no identifying marks or branding.</p>
<p>Honestly, I would not be surprised to learn that it is not even a kitchen tool (my money is on Medieval torture device), but it came from one of the kitchen cabinets, so maybe it belongs there?</p>

### Answer 
<p>This is an ice crusher.</p>

<p>You put some cubes (or use your ice pick to cut a hunk off from a large block), put it in the compartment, and squeeze it closed. Those gnarly bumps and teeth will crush the ice.</p>
<p>I would personally consider it more &quot;home bar equipment&quot; for crushing ice for cocktails, though that's certainly not the only use. As mentioned in the comments, it probably doubles as a decent nutcracker, though that's not it's intended purpose.</p>
