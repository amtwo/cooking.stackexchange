### Q: Finishing pre-cooked prime rib, day-of?
<p>I’m ordering a 6lb. bone-out prime rib roast from a local butcher. I want to have them season and (mostly) cook it for me in their rotisserie on Christmas Eve (pickup at 4pm) so I can just finish it quickly in my oven Christmas Day (12pm).</p>

<p>I have a couple questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>what internal temperature should I ask them to cook? Thinking 110°.</li>
<li>what’s the best method to finish it? I’m thinking rest to room temperature then 375° uncovered oven roast until 120° internal to get a crisp herb crusted exterior (as opposed to a foil tent or foil wrap).</li>
<li>am I insane? Should I just roast it all myself?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks!</p>

### Answer 
<p>Your goal is to reduce cooking time. Having your roast previously partially cooked won't help.</p>

<p>Ultimately, on Christmas Day, you'll need to heat a 6-lb roast from &lt;40°F (fridge temp) to >120°F(cooked temp). That will take roughly the same amount of time whether it's raw or partially cooked. There's some variance, but not enough to matter on your cook time.</p>

<p>The only way you might save time is if you have your roast <strong>FULLY</strong> cooked, then on Christmas Day, you could reheat to a lower temperature than it was previously cooked to. This is essentially how most hams are sold in the US--they are fully cooked and just need to be reheated to serve. </p>

<p>Precooking and reheating doesn't work as well with beef as it does with ham. </p>

<p>Personally, I'd simply get the roast uncooked, and fully cook it myself on Christmas Day.</p>
