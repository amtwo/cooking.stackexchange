### Q: Why consume DRIED apricots within 21 days?
<p>I bought a large bag of dried apricots at Costco. I was planning to enjoy them slowly over the next few months (the Best Before date is in mid 2023) but the label says: &quot;Reseal and refrigerate after opening and <strong>consume within 21 days</strong>.&quot;
I find that weird. Dried fruits usually keep for months and months. The only clue I've got is the ingredient list mentions 2% water. Any idea? Safe to consume after 21 days? 3 month? 6 months? Thank you so much!

### Answer 
<p>As far as food safety goes, you should listen to the package.</p>
<p>These are not just dried fruit. They are &quot;<strong>partially rehydrated</strong> dried apricots&quot;. Once you begin to rehydrate (or if you don't fully dehydrated) fruit, you lose the full preservative effect of drying.</p>
<p>If you want to keep dried fruit outside of refrigeration for an extended period of time, get fruit that is fully dried, and not partially rehydrated.</p>
<p>The label tells us there is 2% <em>added</em> water to the already-dehydrated fruit. We don't know the residual water after drying. What we do know is that &quot;someone&quot; dehydrated the apricots until they were &quot;dry enough,&quot; then this manufacturer added back water equal to 2% of the apricots. If there's 1 kilo of apricots, then 20g (20ml) of water has been rehydrated into the fruit.</p>
<p>Without more info, food safety rules tell us that have to assume that the added water brings it back to the threshold of being perishable, and demanding those labeling instructions.</p>
<p>It's entirely possible that these instructions are intended for quality control and not food safety. However, this is an agricultural product without preservatives where the label indicates refrigeration is required--so food safety rules would treat it as perishable as if it were fresh.</p>
<p>Whether you can still eat it and not get sick might be a different answer; however that question is off topic. This site limits food safety Q&amp;A to government food safety regulations, not anecdotal experience.</p>
