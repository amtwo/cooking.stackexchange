### Q: What is 91/100 CV when referring to olives?
<p>I often see numbers like 91/100 CV when buying olives.</p>
<p>Example: <a href="https://delicias-uk.com/en/inicio/6555-green-olive-macarico-91100-cv-500g" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GREEN OLIVE MACARICO GORDAL 91/100 CV 500G</a></p>
<p>What do these numbers mean? I tried to do some research and I think it might have to do with the size of the olives, but I still cannot figure out what they mean exactly.</p>

<br><br>
### Answer 
<p>Olives are sized by &quot;number of olives per kilogram&quot; (or per pound, in the US). In this case the packaging is 500 grams, so I'd assume we're talking olives per kilo here.</p>
<p>91/100 olives mean that it will take between 91 and 100 olives in a kilo. There are additional requirements to ensure consistent sizing, so that there isn't a mix of golf balls and tiny olives in a given container.</p>
