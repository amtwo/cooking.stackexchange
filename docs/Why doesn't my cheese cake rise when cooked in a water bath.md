### Q: Why doesn't my cheese cake rise when cooked in a water bath?
<p>When I cook a cheesecake using the water bath method, the cheesecake does not rise. It stays flat.  How do I make my cheesecake rise?</p>

<br><br>
### Answer 
<p>The water bath is doing exactly what it should. Most recipes are designed to make your cheesecake rise as little as possible. </p>

<p>Baking a cheesecake is <em>kind of</em> like baking a souffle, except instead of encouraging rise, you combat it. </p>

<p>Cheesecake doesn't have the structure to sustain rising. Cream cheese can't hold the air, so when it rises, it eventually collapses &amp; cracks. </p>

<p>Overmixing can incorporate too much air, which expands when it gets hot and collapses when it cools. Most recipes therefore advise against over mixing. A too-high temperature can have a similar result, converting too much liquid to steam, which expands, then collapses. A water bath insulates against the heat, allowing the cheesecake to cook more gently to combat that "too hot rise"</p>
