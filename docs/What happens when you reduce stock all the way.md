### Q: What happens when you reduce stock all the way?
<p>If you have fully filtered stock or broth, and you boil it until all of the liquid evaporates; what would you be left with. If you boiled only until a bit before that point would you have super compact flavor?</p>

<br><br>
### Answer 
<p>Removing all the liquid out of stock is essentially how bouillon is made. If you managed to dehydrate the stock without burning it, you'll be left with a big disk of bouillon at the bottom of your pot, similar to the cubes you buy at the grocery.</p>
<p>If you leave it with just a little water, you'll have a gooey bouillon paste.</p>
