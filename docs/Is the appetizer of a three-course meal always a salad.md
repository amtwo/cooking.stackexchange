### Q: Is the appetizer of a three-course meal always a salad?
<p>A <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/three-course-meal" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dictionary</a> says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A three-course meal in a local restaurant will not cost more than $10.
  The three-course meal includes an <strong>appetizer</strong>, entrée, and dessert.
  The first course of the three-course meal is a <strong>salad</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems to indicate the appetizer of a three-course meal is always a salad, is it true? Is it true just in the U.S.?</p>

### Answer 
<p>The three sentences you quote are <em>example usage</em> of the phrase, and not part of the definition. These are simply sentences that demonstrate usage of the defined phrase, but are not part of the definition.</p>

<p>The definition, which is always true, is this part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A three-course meal is a meal that consists of three parts served one after the other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other statements that could be true of a three-course meal:</p>

<ul>
<li>A three-course meal can cost significantly more than $10.</li>
<li>The three-course meal could include courses of a salami, a pasta, and a meat.</li>
<li>The last course of a three-course meal could be a salad</li>
</ul>
