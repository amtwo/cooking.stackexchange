### Q: Are "shelled nuts" with or without their shells?
<p>I'm using MyFitnessPal to log what I'm eating, and I can't figure out whether 'shelled pistachios' are pistachios with or without their shells.</p>

<br><br>
### Answer 
<p>In cooking, "shelled" usually means "de-shelled" or "shell-less". This applies to nuts, peas, etc. </p>

<p>The opposite that I've seen most often is "shell" to indicate that they still have their shell. </p>

<p>"Shell peanuts" have their shell intact.
"Shelled peanuts" are just the meat that has been removed from the shell</p>
