### Q: Drying beef to preserve it without any equipment
<p>I have high quality beef muscle meat, beef liver and beef heart. All completely grass fed from healthy animals with clean practices thus I am not that worried about botulism ("Botulism outbreaks occur when animals eat improperly stored or spoiled silage, decaying vegetation, poultry manure, or feed and water contaminated with bird or rodent carcasses.").</p>

<p>Is it possible to air dry thin slices of this meat at home without dehydrator or an oven, in order to preserve it? It's in my apartment so I can't really smoke it.</p>

<br><br>
### Answer 
<p>Simply hanging meat likely won't result in a safe drying environment. The moist, room temperature surface is the environment that bacteria and mold thrive in, which is why <a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/34670/45339">holding food at room temperature is considered unsafe</a>. </p>

<p>Alton Brown offers <a href="https://altonbrown.com/beef-jerky-recipe/" rel="noreferrer">a method for homemade beef jerky</a> without any <em>specialized</em> equipment, but does make use of a box fan and air conditioning filters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Evenly distribute the [thinly sliced, marinaded] strips of meat on 3 of the air filters, laying them in the grooves and then stacking the filters on top of one another. Top these with 1 empty filter. Next, lay the box fan on its side and lay the filters on top of it. Strap the filters to the fan with 2 bungee cords. Stand the fan upright, plug it in, and set it to medium. Dry the meat for 8 to 12 hours. (If using a commercial dehydrator, follow the manufacturerâ€™s directions.)</p>
  
  <p>Once dry, store in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for up to 3 months.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that deviation from Alton's recipe &amp; method may require additional changes to compensate to make it food safe. For example, changing the marinade may affect cure &amp; dry times.</p>
