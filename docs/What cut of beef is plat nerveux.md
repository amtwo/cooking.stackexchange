### Q: What cut of beef is "plat nerveux"?
<p>The cut is 'plat nerveux' and was purchased at a Parisian (French) market. It is beef, long-ish, round (like a sausage), and boneless. The meat is deeper red than most beef cuts I am used to. Deep red, but not liver or other organ color.</p>

<p>This cut is not even listed on <a href="https://tasteofsavoie.com/2018/10/23/french-meat-cuts/" rel="noreferrer">https://tasteofsavoie.com/2018/10/23/french-meat-cuts/</a></p>

### Answer 
<p>Different countries can have very different names for their cuts of meat, and in some cases, there isn't an obvious/direct equivalent from a French cut to an American or English cut. If you look at a French butcher's diagram, you'll see the lines and cuts don't correspond directly to a US diagram.</p>

<p>I believe that what you saw labeled as "plat nerveux" is likely "gite de noix" which in the US is "eye of round roast". "Nerveux de gite" is a braised beef dish that is <em>kind of</em> like an American pot roast. </p>

<p>Eye of round can have a shape similar to a tenderloin, but is a tougher, less expensive cut of meat. </p>
