### Q: Chocolate Sweetening in Ganache
<p>I need 1 more ounce of 60% bakers chocolate, but i only have unsweetened. How much powdered sugar should I add if I add 1 ounce of the unsweetened?
I'm trying to make a ganache.</p>

### Answer 
<p>60% chocolate is roughly the same as semi-sweet chocolate. In most recipes, you can substitute 1oz unsweetened chocolate + 1 Tablespoon granulated white sugar for 1 oz semi-sweet chocolate. </p>

<p>This substitution ratio may not always scale perfectly for baking (ex, 16 oz unsweetened + 1 cup sugar may not be the right substitution for 16 oz semi-sweet in a cake), but it works well for partial substitutions like yours, and in ganache, hot chocolate, etc. </p>
