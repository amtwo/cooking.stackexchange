### Q: How much potato to add to reduce saltiness
<p>I've heard that adding potato to an overly salty dish can reduce the saltiness.</p>
<p>I prepared 500g of rabbit meat in a pressure cooker. Realized that I had added one teaspoon worth of salt more than what was necessary. Since the meat seemed to need a bit more cooking anyway, I peeled and sliced a medium sized potato and dunked it into the pressure cooker which still had the rabbit curry in it, and re-cooked it on medium flame until steam formation.  I assume this is the right way to add potato. Not sure if the potato can be boiled separately and then added to a curry to reduce saltiness.</p>
<p>Two hours later I opened it and I'm not quite sure if the saltiness reduced...though it seemed like it did a bit.</p>
<p>So in this kind of a situation, for the proportions I mentioned, how much potato (in grams or size) would be required to reduce excess saltiness? Perhaps the saltiness could be quantified as excess by the number of teaspoons added beyond &quot;just right&quot;.</p>
<p>I know different people like different proportions of salt. Please dont focus on the salt. The question is about how much of potato to add to 500g of any dish to have a noticeable reduction in saltiness.</p>

### Answer 
<h2>Let's talk potatoes</h2>
<p>Potatoes are kind of bland &amp; starchy on their own. If you boil potatoes &amp; eat them with no salt, they just taste like nothing. Most &quot;plain&quot; potato preparations will use salt &amp; a bit of fat to make the potato taste more like potato. On the other end of the spectrum, you can put <em>a lot</em> of salt onto potatoes without them tasting &quot;too salty.&quot; Fast food french fries can have quite a bit of salt on the outside, and the starchy, bland inside will offset all that salt.</p>
<h2>Potatoes to fix salty food</h2>
<p>That last bit of the above paragraph basically explains why adding potatoes to a salty dish can work. Potatoes &quot;take&quot; a lot of salt themselves, so if you've put too much salt in a soup or curry, adding unsalted potato will equalize that as the potatoes &quot;take on&quot; and &quot;absorb&quot; some of that saltiness from the liquid they are in. Other bland, starchy foods work well as a &quot;salt sponge&quot; too--rice or pasta or even bread or flour tortillas. Potatoes have an advantage that they can either be broken up &amp; kind of turned into a thickener for the sauce/soup/whatever, or they can be left in big enough chunks that you can fish them out easily and not include them in the final product--where rice, pasta, bread, and tortillas are more difficult to make disappear.</p>
<p>How much potato you need will vary, and in my experience there is no &quot;1 potato per <code>x</code> quarts of liquid&quot; formula, because there are just too many factors (including personal preference). The easiest way for me to estimate how much potato to add is to think in terms of &quot;how much extra salt did I add?&quot;</p>
<p>You mention that you probably added 1 teaspoon too much salt, so per my advice, you'd think backwards to &quot;how much potato do I need to cook to directly add 1 teaspoon of salt to season it?&quot; and go from there. You might be able to add less or need more than that guess--but that's essentially what you're doing.</p>
<p><strong>If you were cooking 1 potato by itself, how much salt would you use on it?</strong> If you would use 1 teaspoon of salt on 1 potato, then you need 1 potato to try to &quot;fix&quot; your &quot;1 teaspoon too salty&quot; curry. If you would use 1/2 teaspoon of salt on 1 potato, then you need 2 potatoes to fix your curry. Practically speaking, you probably need several potatoes (or many potatoes if they are small) to offset 1 teaspoon of salt by themselves.</p>
<h2>But it doesn't always work</h2>
<p>There's always an exception. If <strong>everything</strong> in the dish has absorbed too much salt, potatoes might not be enough to fix it. Potatoes do really well at taking on the salt from the sauce or liquid that they are cooking in. However, if there are meat &amp; veggies &amp; other things that have already absorbed &quot;too much&quot; salt, potatoes might not do the trick.</p>
