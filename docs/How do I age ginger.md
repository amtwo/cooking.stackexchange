### Q: How do I age ginger?
<p>For the past few months all I can find is young ginger from the grocers. I am in need of old ginger which I can't quite purchase.</p>
<p>I have tried to leave it out in the kitchen in an open basket (no sunlight) but it went all mouldy. When I did this, the average temperatures in my (Australian) city were a high of 30C and a low of 15C.</p>
<p>How can I age young ginger, so as to have 'old' ginger?</p>

### Answer 
<h2>What's the difference?</h2>
<p>I did a little research, and <a href="https://harvesttotable.com/ginger_half_spicy_and_peppery/#:%7E:text=Mature%20ginger%20is%20more%20pungent,a%20dried%20or%20powdered%20ginger." rel="noreferrer">this article</a> does a good job at summarizing both the taste difference, and the growing difference.</p>
<p>Young ginger (or spring ginger) is harvested at the start of the growing season, before it has gotten as fibrous, and when the exterior skin is still thin &amp; delicate. It also has  a more mild flavor. Mature ginger (what the OP calls &quot;old ginger&quot; is simply grown longer and has a tougher skin, and more pungent taste.</p>
<p>Full text from the above article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fresh ginger is available both young and mature.</p>
<p><strong>Spring ginger.</strong> Young ginger which is sometimes called spring ginger has a very thin skin that requires no peeling. The skin is edible. Young ginger is very tender and has a milder flavor than mature ginger. Young ginger is found in Asian markets in the springtime.</p>
<p><strong>Mature ginger.</strong> Mature ginger is usually harvested in the fall and has a tough skin that must be carefully peeled to reach the flesh underneath. Mature ginger is more pungent than young ginger.</p>
<p>Just harvested ginger—whether young or mature–should have a fresh, spicy fragrance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>So what can you do?</h2>
<p>Once it's harvested, there isn't really a way to &quot;mature&quot; it at home in your kitchen. That needs to happen when it's still in the garden. You could try simply using a &quot;heavier hand&quot; and use more ginger to compensate for the slightly more delicate flavor, though that still won't be the same thing as using mature ginger to begin with.</p>
