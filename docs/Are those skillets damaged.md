### Q: Are those skillets damaged?
<p>I'm posting links to photos on Dropbox of 3 de Buyer skillets I own. They have been placed into the dishwasher over and over again against my advice unfortunately.</p>
<p>I want to know if what I'm seeing on them now is rust, and if so are they permanently damaged or is there something I can do to revive them?</p>

### Answer 
<p>These appear to be carbon steel pans. Carbon steel pans are similar to cast iron in that they are raw/uncoated metal and need to be seasoned to maintain a proper (rust free) cooking surface. The big different from cast iron is simply that carbon steel is thinner, and less massive--which makes it more responsive to heat changes, as it holds less heat within itself.</p>
<p>Virtually all advice for care of cast iron pans also applies to carbon steel. <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/2010/06/how-to-buy-season-clean-maintain-cast-iron-pans.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">How to care for cast iron advice</a> is plentiful on the internet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop using the dishwasher. The detergent in a dishwasher is far too aggressive and will wash away seasoning.</li>
<li>Dry the pan immediately &amp; thoroughly after washing--popping it on the stove to heat it up works great.</li>
</ul>
<h3>To finally answer your question...</h3>
<p>Your pans aren't ruined--they just need some love. Your carbon steel pans can be easily saved with <a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/641/45339">re-seasoning</a>. This is simply a matter of scrubbing the rust off, and going through a process to <em>polymerize</em> oil on the surface to prevent future rust.</p>
<p>Then, have an intervention with the person who loves to put them though the dishwasher, and explain that they are abusing these pans and need to start hand washing them.</p>
