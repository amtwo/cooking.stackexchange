### Q: How can I clean utensils (e.g., knives) used to cut longkongs?
<p>After using utensils to prepare/eat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Longkong" rel="nofollow noreferrer">longkongs</a>, the utensils are very sticky (by far stickier than for any other types of fruit that I have tried so far). I tried to use soap and dishwashing liquid, as well as letting the utensils in the water for a few hours, but the  utensils are still sticky.</p>

<p>How can I clean utensils (e.g., knives) used to cut longkongs?</p>

### Answer 
<p>The stickiness is similarly stubborn as trying to clean up pine sap, where regular soap often will not clean it up. </p>

<p>Instead, try using mineral oil to clean up. You might have mineral oil in the kitchen for oiling cutting boards. ("Baby oil" is a form of mineral oil that also has fragrances added.) Simply rub the sticky utensils with a towel and mineral oil until the stickiness is gone.</p>

<p>After cleaning the sticky longdong sap off your knives with mineral oil, you will then be able to then wash off the mineral oil with soap and water. </p>
