### Q: Are chilies a common ingredient in Italian cooking?
<p>I just read this article in CNN "Eating chilies cuts risk of death from heart attack and stroke, study says" and when I read this line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Carried out in Italy, where chili is a common ingredient, the study
  compared the risk of death among 23,000 people, some of whom ate chili
  and some of whom didn't.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've seen that some Italian dishes call for the addition of dried chili flakes, but a common ingredient? I'm married to a Malay - chili peppers <em>are</em> a common ingredient. It seems as common as salt.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm thinking of the wrong types of chili peppers. We always have a supply of Thai chilies around, but no pepperoncinis.
So what have I missed in Italian cooking where chilies are a common ingredient?</p>

<p>Or is what we have here in America as Italian cooking just isn't the real deal?</p>

### Answer 
<p>I'd like to point out that the detail in your quote is "where chili is a common ingredient" </p>

<p>Using chilies <em>often</em> is not the same thing as always eating spicy food. Southern Italian cooking uses chilies <em>often</em>, but not necessarily to create very spicy food. </p>

<p>Some preparations (arrabiata, fra diavolo, etc) may be spicy, but many things can use chilies and not be hot and spicy--milder chilies, or smaller amounts can be used simply to create flavor, without heat. </p>

<p>I think it's fair to say that Italian cooking uses chilies <strong><em>often</em></strong> while also clarifying that Italian cooking uses significantly less chilies (volume wise) than some other cuisine known for being hot &amp; spicy.</p>
