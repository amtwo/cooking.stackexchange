### Q: Converting fresh chilli pepper to ground?
<p>If I normally use a fresh chilli pepper but decide to use the ground version, how do I convert for measuring the amount of ground? For example, 1 fresh pepper = 1 heaped teaspoon ground pepper.</p>

<br><br>
### Answer 
<p>Fresh pepper/chili and ground pepper/chili are not particularly interchangeable. </p>

<p>For example: (sweet) paprika is essentially ground Bell pepper, but it is not a normal substitution to use replace Bell pepper with <em>x</em> teaspoons of paprika. </p>

<p>Additionally, peppers range in size substantially. A Thai Birdseye chili would only yield a fraction of a teaspoon when dried and ground. A bell pepper is probably more likely to yield a tablespoon or more, depending on the drying process. </p>
