### Q: Less sweet / lower sugar alternative to icing?
<p>When making a cake as a base line I usually halve the recommended sugar as I find it too sweet. Now I want to ice the cake for appearance and colour I notice that icing recipes are loaded with sugar.  Is there a less sweet / lower sugar alternative that will allow me to decorate the cake</p>

### Answer 
<p>My favorite choice is an <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/06/basic-italian-meringue-recipe.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Italian meringue</a>. </p>

<p>Italian meringue is whipped egg whites with still-hot simple syrup added. The addition of hot syrup cooks the egg whites, making it quite safe to eat without additional cooking. </p>

<p>The drawback is that it does not keep as well as a buttercream, and will require refrigeration if you're not going to eat it same day</p>
