### Q: Today's equivalent of a cake of yeast
<p>I came across one of my mother's cookbooks from 1954.  A lot of the baked goods call for &quot;1 cake of yeast&quot;.  What would be the equivalent of this in today's supermarket?</p>

<br><br>
### Answer 
<p>You <em>can</em> find fresh cake yeast in grocery stores, but it's much less common than active dry yeast granulates.</p>
<p>1 cake of fresh yeast is approximately the same as 1 envelope/packet of active dry yeast. 1 packet usually equals about 2¼ teaspoons, or ¼ ounce, or 7 grams of active dry yeast granules.</p>
