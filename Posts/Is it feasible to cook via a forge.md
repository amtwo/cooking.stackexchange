### Q: Is it feasible to cook via a forge?
<p>I was playing the Sims Medieval the other day, and at one point, the blacksmith proves s/he's a capable cook by... taking a piece of meat, firing up the forge, and hammering the thing into a steak.</p>
<p>It's obviously done tongue-in-cheek, but it got me thinking - <strong>is</strong> it somehow possible to use a forge (bellows, coal, anvil, the works) to produce something actually edible?</p>
<p>If 'yes', what sort of constraints (e.g. necessary preparations, limitations on what kind of foods you could prepare) would there be?</p>
<p>Putting aside issues of cost and practicality.</p>

### Answer 
<p>Forges operate at extremely high temperatures. Steel gets that &quot;glow&quot; of red around 900°F/480°C. So if we want to consider the coldest possible temperature, that's it (but likely much higher).</p>
<p>There are a limited number of foods that could be cooked at that temperature and be enjoyably edible. For most foods, temperatures that high will burn the outside before cooking the inside.</p>
<p>You'd really be limited to things like flatbread, pizza, or very thin strips of meat.  Essentially things that have a lot of surface area to cook, but not much internal mass that needs to be brought up to temperature. Maybe even something like popcorn? Either way, that surface-to-mass ratio will be important.</p>
<p>There may be other things that are <em>possible</em> but not <em>practical</em> given enough creativity. Ex) You could heat the anvil, then use it's thermal mass to cook on. Because of the impractically, but possibility, it feels more fun as a <a href="https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/">world building</a> exercise than a cooking one.</p>
