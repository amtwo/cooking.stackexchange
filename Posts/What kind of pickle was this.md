### Q: What kind of pickle was this?
<p>A while ago, I ate a charcuterie board that had, among other things, a strange pickled vegetable that I had never seen before and have not heard of since.</p>
<p>I say vegetable but it was probably a fruit.</p>
<ul>
<li>It was green and round, only a bit larger than a nickel.</li>
<li>The pickle came with a thin hard stem attached to it, like a green bean's stem, only longer and thinner. I'd say it was about 2 inches and attached to the fruit with a very small cap (or <em>calyx</em> according to Wikipedia)</li>
<li>It had large hard seeds inside it, I think there were 8 in there. They reminded me of guava seeds.</li>
<li>It had lighter green striations running across parallel from the stem.</li>
<li>The taste was hard to describe. Vegetal like kale and sweet like a sweet pickle. It was pickled so I don't know how much of that taste was inherent in the plant and how much was the pickle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does anyone know what kind of pickle I ate?</p>

### Answer 
<p>It sounds like you may be describing a <a href="https://tastessence.com/what-are-caper-berries" rel="noreferrer">caper berry</a>. Most folks are familiar with capers, which are the pickled or salted flower bud from the caper plant. However, if the buds are left to mature into fruit, it becomes a caper berry.</p>
<p>Caper berries (like capers) are usually pickled or salted, are about the size of a grape (and vary in size, like grapes), and often packaged with stems intact.</p>
<p>This image shows caper berries in the upper left, and also in the center of the salad itself:
