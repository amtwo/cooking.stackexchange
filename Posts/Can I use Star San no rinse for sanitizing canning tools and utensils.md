### Q: Can I use Star San "no rinse" for sanitizing canning tools and utensils?
<p>I've been brewing beer (totally amateur) for a few years as a hobby. I now want to get into canning my own garden-grown veggies.</p>
<p>I've bought several books and watched several videos (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMUFIkg39oM" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this one</a> from Ball) which recommend:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using hot soapy water to clean all jars, lids and bands/rings; as well as all other utensils (ladles, jar funnels, jar lifters, cutting boards, etc.)</li>
<li>Keeping the lids in hot water (not boiling) until ready to be used</li>
</ol>
<p>In brewing there is a product called <a href="https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/star-san" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Star San</a> that is a &quot;no rinse&quot; sanitation solution. You basically dip your utensils into a tub of it, take them out and they are ready to be used.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if this product would be safe and effective for use in canning. Any thoughts?</p>

### Answer 
<p>No rinse sanitizer like Star San works great for sanitizing canning tools &amp; jars. The sanitary considerations for canning and beer have quite a bit in common, so for the most part, if you sanitize things like you're bottling, you'll be in great shape.</p>
<h2>Except...</h2>
<p>You'll still want to follow the instructions to simmer your flat lids. The rubber seal on the lid needs the heat to &quot;activate&quot; in order for it to be appropriately soft to create a good seal between the lid &amp; jar.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>
I just grabbed a package of lids to check the instructions, and they appear to have changed to no longer recommend / require the hot water simmering prep. A quick internet suggests this changed about 5 years ago. Who knew?!</p>
<p>I've been  continuing to simmer the lids for about 5 minutes before canning--and probably will keep doing so out of habit. However, it would seem that based on the package directions, you just need to sanitize, not heat. So Star San should do the trick for the lids as well!</p>
