### Q: How many cells are in one granule of instant yeast?
<p>I'm purely curious and google has failed me.</p>

### Answer 
<p><a href="http://www.mrmalty.com/calc/dry.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This article</a> estimates 20 billion viable yeast cells per gram of dried yeast. <a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/43882/45339">A yeast package is about 7 grams total</a>.</p>

<p>The granule size will vary from brand to brand. Even within a packet, granule size is not completely uniform. To get the estimate, you'd need to weigh out a sample (say 1g or 0.1g), count the number of granules in that sample, then do the math. The larger the sample you count, the better estimate you'll have.</p>
