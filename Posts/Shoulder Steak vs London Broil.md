### Q: Shoulder Steak vs London Broil
<p>I bought a piece of shoulder steak. Can I cook it like a london broil - marinating it and then broiling for around fifteen minutes?</p>

<br><br>
### Answer 
<p>Shoulder steak &amp; London broil are often used interchangeably. I won't bother with technical/pedantic differences, as practically speaking, the exact same cut of meat may be labeled &quot;shoulder steak&quot; at one grocer and &quot;London broil&quot; at another.</p>
<p>So yes, your shoulder steak <em>is</em> what you are used to seeing as London broil. So you can cook it exactly the same. 😁</p>
