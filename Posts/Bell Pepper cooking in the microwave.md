### Q: Bell Pepper cooking in the microwave
<p>When I microwave sliced bell peppers, they spark like they have metal in them.
Does the bell peppers have any metal pieces?</p>

<br><br>
### Answer 
<h1>Yes. But probably not the way most people think of &quot;metal&quot;</h1>
<p>Certain vegetables are very rich in minerals. These minerals, like iron, are an important part of nutrition. It's not metallic in the way we usually think of &quot;metals&quot; being shiny, sharp, and hard.</p>
<p>It's the same iron that in it's pure state gets used to make cast iron pans--but it's in relatively tiny amounts scattered throughout your food and water.</p>
<h1>⚡💥</h1>
<p>So why do some veggies cause &quot;arcing&quot; in the microwave? Arcing isn't necessarily caused by <em>a lot of</em> metal. It's actually caused by uneven metal content. A flat, smooth sheet of aluminum may not arc at all, but a smaller ball of aluminum foil can cause a major lightning storm in your microwave. Veggies that are particularly mineral rich will be more prone to having uneven distribution between different plants, or even within a single plant.</p>
<p>That means two pieces of bell pepper, either from different peppers or different ends of the same pepper, can have different metal/mineral content, and result in arcing.</p>
<p>Leafy greens in particular have a high iron content, and are prone to this behavior. I've had fresh kale cause some big sparks before. <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/10/03/495975189/snap-crackle-kale-the-science-of-why-veggies-spark-in-the-microwave" rel="noreferrer">This NPR article</a> goes into more detail.</p>
